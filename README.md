### Details
A common problem in most households is not knowing what to eat for dinner. This program will solve that problem by providing recipe options based on the ingredients one already has or the ingredients they prefer.
This site will provide a list of recipes based on the users preferences.
The user will be able to see the recipe card and recipe information.


I would like to add a save feature to the program.
### Technology 

1. React
2. React-Bootstrap

### Possible Roadblocks 

Save feature using Firebase or any other backend platform.



### Tentative Timeline 
1. Start Main Page, Buttons, Routing, Links, CSS

2. Start Main Recipe page, add API , add content, CSS

3. Create single recipe card components, add links, CSS

4. Create search form to narrow search results through "Get Started" button

5. Discover save feature options
